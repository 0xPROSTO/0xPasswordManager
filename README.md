0xPasswordManager is an open source password manager made by 0xPROSTO (aka ZeroX; ProjectEVA02).
You can safely store your data in it, encryption is done via cryptography.fernet: After the first run a secret.key file will be created, it is needed to decrypt passwords. Don't lose it!

If you need to run the program via .py and installing requirements.txt fails, manually install PyQt6 and cryptography (pip install pyqt6 cryptography).
